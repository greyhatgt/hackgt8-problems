Difficulty: Medium

Description: It seems like my last version of reverse minesweeper had a critcal flaw. I think I fixed it, can you check my implementation?
Flag: `hackgt8{R3pl4y_4tt4ck5_4r3_4_cl4ss1c}`

Note:
- share `app.py`, but do not share `create_board.py`

Hints (reveal these if there's not many solves or it otherwise makes sense):
1. The intended solution does not involve cracking the encryption.
2. You can't brute force blindly and be successful, but the solution involves some brute force. In the worst case, 94 guesses are needed.
